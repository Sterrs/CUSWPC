 - Check people's emails are actually correct
 - Update the main GNUCash file
 - Copy it to CUSWPC.gnucash
 - Extract the csv using extract_csv.py; this also generates [team]_bills_to_send.py
 - Turn the csv into tex using bill_csv_to_tex.py
 - Run `for f in tex/*.tex; do pdflatex "$f"; done` in the bills directory
 - Copy all the bills to the danger/actual_bills directory
 - Copy whichever team you want to send the bills to to the danger directory
 - MODIFY THE bills_to_send.csv FILE TO REMOVE PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE SENT A BILL
 - Run the send_bills.py script
 - Realise it didn't actually send any bills because you made it not do that
 - Modify the script so it's primed, and run it again
 - Hope nothing goes wrong
 - Good luck mate
